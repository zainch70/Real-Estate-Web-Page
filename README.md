Real Estate Project using HTML, CSS, and PHP make sure you have a dashboard background video

In this real estate project, I developed a dynamic website that allows users to browse, search, and manage property listings. The front end was built using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface, while the backend was developed with PHP to handle data processing and interactions with a MySQL database.

Key Features:

    Property Listings: The website displays property details, including images, descriptions, prices, and locations. Users can easily browse through the available properties.
    Search and Filter: Users can search for properties based on criteria like location, price range, and property type, making it easier to find specific listings.
    Purchased Properties: The website allows users to view properties they have purchased, keeping track of their acquisitions.
    Add Records in Purchase and Sale: Administrators can add records of new purchases or sales, ensuring that the transaction history is accurately maintained.
    Sold Properties: A section is provided to list properties that have been sold, offering a clear overview of completed transactions.
    User Authentication: The project includes a user authentication system, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. This feature is essential for saving favorite properties or making inquiries.
